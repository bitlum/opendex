# Introduction

![](/images/OpenDEX_Full_Transparent.png)

**OpenDEX is a global network for unstoppable P2P trading of cryptocurrencies and tokens.** It is built on top of the [Lightning](https://lightning.network/) and [Raiden](https://raiden.network/) network and at its core, it is comprised by a set of open protocol specifications, called **BOLD** (for Basis of L3 DEX). These specifications ensure that OpenDEX nodes remain compatible and users of different software implementations are able to trade with each other. **OpenDEX is not a company** or any other sort of legal entity, it is an open community of motivated individuals maintaining the BOLD specifications. OpenDEX was started because we believe there should be only one DEX, **one global trading network**, not hundreds. Find the slides from the first public announcement at #hcpp19 in Prague [here](201901005_hcpp19.pdf) and the video recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euSr9A6tI90).
